# Robotic Designer Track

> **Transform ideas into physical reality through mechanical design and rapid prototyping**

## Track Overview

The Robotic Designer track focuses on the mechanical and structural aspects of robotics. You'll master CAD tools, 3D printing techniques, and mechanical design principles to create innovative robotic systems.

## What You'll Learn

### Foundation Skills
- **CAD Fundamentals**: Parametric modeling, assemblies, drawings
- **3D Printing**: FDM, SLA, material properties, optimization
- **Materials Science**: Plastics, metals, composites for robotics
- **Mechanical Principles**: Linkages, gears, transmissions

### Advanced Topics
- **Kinematic Design**: Joint design, workspace optimization
- **Structural Analysis**: FEA, stress testing, safety factors
- **Design for Manufacturing**: Tolerances, assembly considerations
- **Biomimetic Design**: Nature-inspired mechanisms

## Core Projects

### Project 1: Custom Gripper Design
Design and manufacture a custom gripper for the SO-101 arm:
- Analyze gripping requirements
- Create parametric CAD model
- Optimize for 3D printing
- Test and iterate design

### Project 2: Modular Joint System
Develop a modular joint system for rapid robot prototyping:
- Design standard interfaces
- Create family of joint modules
- Implement quick-connect system
- Document assembly process

### Project 3: Humanoid Hand Prototype
Design a biomimetic robotic hand:
- Study human hand anatomy
- Design tendon-driven system
- Create flexible joints
- Integrate with control systems

## Tools & Software

### Required Software
- **Fusion 360** or **FreeCAD**: Primary CAD tool
