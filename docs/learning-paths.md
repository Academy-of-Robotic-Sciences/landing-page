# 🚀 Robot Campus – Intensive Bootcamp Tracks

> **From Zero to Robot Builder in Days, Not Months**

Build real robots through intensive, hands-on bootcamp sessions. Each track is a series of focused workshops where you build, code, and ship working prototypes.

---

## 🎯 Bootcamp Philosophy

**Traditional Education:** Read → Learn → Test → Maybe Build
**Robot Campus:** Build → Break → Fix → Ship 🚀

Each bootcamp session is **2-8 hours** of pure hands-on building. No homework. No lengthy theory. Just intensive, focused skill acquisition with immediate results.
