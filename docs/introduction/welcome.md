# Welcome to Academy of Robotic Sciences (ARS)

> **Building the Next Generation of Humanoid Robotics**

## Our Mission

Academy of Robotic Sciences (ARS) is an open-source educational platform dedicated to training the next generation of robotic experts through hands-on, project-based learning. We believe that the future of humanoid robotics lies in accessible, practical education that bridges the gap between theory and real-world application.

## What Makes Us Different

### 🤖 Real Hardware, Real Learning
Work with actual robotic hardware including the **SO-100/SO-101 Arm**, not just simulations. Build, calibrate, and program real robots that you can touch and see move.

### 🧠 Cutting-Edge AI Integration
Master modern AI frameworks with **LeRobot** - learn imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and sim-to-real transfer techniques used in today's most advanced robotics labs.

### 🛠️ Complete Stack Education
From mechanical design and 3D printing to AI and systems integration - we cover the entire robotics stack. Choose your specialization or become a full-stack robotics engineer.

### 🌍 Open Source Community
Join a global community of learners, builders, and innovators. All our materials, designs, and code are open source. Learn from others, contribute your projects, and help shape the future of robotics education.

## Your Learning Journey

Academy of Robotic Sciences (ARS) offers five specialized learning tracks, each designed to develop expertise in a critical area of humanoid robotics:

### Choose Your Path

- **[Robotic Designer](/docs/tracks/design)** - Master CAD, 3D printing, and mechanical systems
- **[Robotic Hardware Engineer](/docs/tracks/hardware)** - Build with electronics, sensors, and actuators
- **[Robotic Software Engineer](/docs/tracks/software)** - Program kinematics, motion planning, and control systems
- **[Robotic AI Engineer](/docs/tracks/ai)** - Train robots with machine learning and computer vision
- **[Robotic Systems Engineer](/docs/tracks/systems)** - Integrate complete robotic systems

## Core Projects

### 🦾 SO-100/SO-101 Arm
Design, build, and program a 6-DOF robotic arm from scratch. Learn servo control, inverse kinematics, and task planning.

### 🤖 LeRobot AI Training
Train robots to perform complex tasks using imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Bridge the sim-to-real gap.

### 🎯 3D Prototyping Lab
Design and manufacture custom robot parts, grippers, and enclosures using CAD and 3D printing.
