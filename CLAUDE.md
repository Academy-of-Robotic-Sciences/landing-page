# Academy of Robotic Sciences (ARS) – Context Document

## Brand
**Name:** Academy of Robotic Sciences (ARS)
**Tagline:** *Building the Next Generation of Humanoid Robotics*

**Mission:**
- Train robotic experts through open, project-based learning.
- Use **SO-100/SO-101 Arm**, **LeRobot**, and **3D prototyping** as anchors.
- Build a **community** that learns, builds, and shares together.
