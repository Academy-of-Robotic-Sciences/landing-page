# Welcome to Robot Campus! 🤖

We're thrilled to announce the official launch of **Robot Campus** - your gateway to mastering humanoid robotics through hands-on, project-based learning. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced maker, we have a path designed for you.

<!-- truncate -->

## Our Mission

Robot Campus exists to democratize robotics education. We believe that the future of humanoid robotics shouldn't be limited to elite institutions or well-funded labs. Through open-source materials, affordable hardware, and a supportive global community, we're making advanced robotics accessible to everyone.

## What Makes Us Different?

### 🔧 Real Hardware, Real Learning

Unlike purely theoretical courses, Robot Campus emphasizes building actual robots. Our flagship project, the **SO-100/SO-101 robotic arm**, costs less than $200 to build but teaches principles used in industrial robotics. You'll work with real sensors, actuators, and control systems - not just simulations.

### 🧠 Cutting-Edge AI Integration

Through our partnership with the **LeRobot framework**, you'll learn to train robots using the same techniques employed by leading AI labs:
- Imitation learning
- Reinforcement learning
- Sim-to-real transfer
- Computer vision integration

### 🌍 Open Source Everything

All our materials are open source:
- Course content and curricula
- Hardware designs and STL files
- Software and code examples
- Community projects

You're not just learning - you're contributing to a growing ecosystem.

## Five Learning Tracks

We offer specialized paths tailored to different interests and career goals:

### 1. **Robotic Designer** 🎨
Master CAD, 3D printing, and mechanical design. Perfect for those who love creating physical systems.

### 2. **Robotic Hardware Engineer** ⚡
Dive deep into electronics, sensors, and embedded systems. Build the nervous system of robots.

### 3. **Robotic Software Engineer** 💻
Program robots using ROS2, implement control algorithms, and create autonomous behaviors.

### 4. **Robotic AI Engineer** 🧠
Train robots to learn and adapt using machine learning and computer vision.

### 5. **Robotic Systems Engineer** 🔧
Integrate complete systems and deploy production-ready robots.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Track
Review our [Learning Tracks Overview](/docs/tracks/overview) to find the path that matches your interests and goals.

### Step 2: Join the Community
- **Discord**: [Join our server](https://discord.gg/robotcampus) for real-time help and discussions
- **GitHub**: Star our repositories and contribute
- **Forum**: Engage in deeper technical discussions

### Step 3: Set Up Your Workspace
Depending on your track, you'll need:
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Basic tools (varies by track)
- Optional: 3D printer access, Arduino/Raspberry Pi

### Step 4: Start Learning
Begin with our foundation courses (RC-101 through RC-106) that all students complete, then dive into your specialized track.

## Success Stories Already Emerging

Even in our beta phase, students have achieved amazing things:
- Maria built a chess-playing robot that's beaten several club players
- Alex's agricultural robot prototype attracted seed funding
- The Berlin study group created a swarm of mini-robots that dance in sync
